    <p>Hi! My name is Jessica and I'm passionate about bringing technology to lower income community. During high school I worked for the nonprofit Paidea United as their Finance Head, fundraising money to donate technology to school districts in Peru. In my free time I like visiting new places and eating new food! </p>
    <p>My hometown is Cerritos in Southern California. </p>
